We need to look at some plausible but ultimately incorrect ideas about what distinguishes conscious from unconscious states.<br />Here I will make a bunch of statements of the form "conscious states are not <i>x</i>".<br /><br /><b>Unconscious Actions Can Integrate Information</b><br />There is a general consensus among cognitive scientists that conscious states involve bringing together data from many different senses <br />The integration consensus<br /><br />When determining flavor, you unconsciously combine smell and taste data into a single flavor. The experience of hunger integrates data from blood sugar levels, fat stores, and temperature.<br /><br />Furthermore, unconscious processes can resolve conflicts between differing sensory data. A prime example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect">McGurk Effect</a>: when you hear the sound /ba/ but see a mouth making the movements for /da/, you perceive the syllable /ga/. The fact that there was ever a conflict between the visual and auditory data is not made apparent to your conscious mind. Similarly<br /><br />The most popular mathematical formalization of these ideas is called Integrated Information Theory, which defines a value, phi, that attempts to measure how much information is distributed between different subsystems. This is used as a measure of how conscious the overall system is. Scott Aaronson has a <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799">great post</a> demonstrating that clearly unconscious systems, such as error-correcting codes in your DVD player, can have arbitrarily large values of phi.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Unconscious Actions Can Be Complex</b><br />In alien and anarchic hand syndrome, a patient's hand can move on its own, sometimes actively interfering with the patient's desires and the behavior of the opposite hand. The hand will not move at random, but with complex, goal-directed patterns. Similarly, people who exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization_behavior">utilization behavior</a> will automatically, unconsciously interact with certain objects <br />We can also all relate to the feeling of having suddenly arrived somewhere, whether it's staring into an open fridge, driving into a parking lot, or opening Facebook in another tab. Learned action patterns can be transferred from conscious to semi-conscious to unconscious control.<br /><br /><br /><b>Unconscious Processing Can Include Top-Down Control</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Conscious states specifically allow communication between<br /><br />The difference between instrumental and incentive systems can be seen in addiction. Often people will continue executing a behavior they are addicted to even when they don't feel any associated reward.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE<br />What function does having a single, unified "self" hold?<br />Under what conditions to people feel like they have lost their "self"?<br />Everyone<br />Since the body and mind can be used for an arbitrary space of action patterns, there needs to be a way of determining<br /><br />The self is the social analogue of consciousness. Where consciousness mediates bodily action, the self mediates social action (the body skeletal vs. the body politic).<br /><script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js" type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Config({  extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],  tex2jax: {      inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],  },  "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] } }); </script>

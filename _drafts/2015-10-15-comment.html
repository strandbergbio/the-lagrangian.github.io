<div><b>Here's the key thing: a "personality" is an attractor in the space of human action patterns.</b><br /><br /><br /><br />In alien hand syndrome, patients report that they feel like a spirit has possessed their hand<br />Is this <i>caused</i>&nbsp;by<br /><br />Hermetics- pretend your hand is possessed (?)<br />ouija board- feel like it is moving your hand<br />OUIJA IS AN IMPROV GAME<br /><br />Capgras syndrome (often referred to as "capgras delusion" but I feel "syndrome" is much less judgmental)<br /><br />"identity" politics is actually about membership in extremely large groups-<br />If you're male or female, your gender identity is one<br /><br /><br /><br />Morsella refers to "phenomenal states" (as in states relating to phenomena, not super-amazing states)</div><div><br /><br /><br /></div><div>Our notion of personality comes from modelling other people and modelling other people is mostly optimized for the sake of social interaction, so this makes sense.<br />It is then interesting to note that most of our experience of internal coherence comes from social predictions</div><div><br /></div><div>The fact that someone whose job it is to take on other personalities is called an "actor" ought to be a great tip-off here. Not an "emoter" or a "qualia-er," but an actor.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Johnstone refers to these characters as Masks, with an intentional capital "M." There is a reason for this- it feels as though one is channeling a pre-existing character<br />This is well-corroborated by the fact that different actors putting on the same mask seem to become the same Mask</div><div><br /></div><div>Different personalities are invoked by different action plans <i>because</i>&nbsp;a personality is an attractor in the space of action plans. After all, the whole point of personality&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>When you have conflicting action plans, you often internally represent this as a battle between different agents:<br /><ul><li>In moral dilemmas we have the canonical example of an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other.&nbsp;</li><li>When doing soliloquies, a good technique is to develop two (or more) internal voices that squabble with each other.&nbsp;</li><li>In dissociative identity disorder, something so traumatic happens to you that you are forced to split separate personalities in order to handle the conflict (though it's important to remember that <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/dispelling-myths-about-dissociative-identity-disorder/0009785?all=1" target="_blank">most people with DID don't have such dramatic personality changes as you see in Hollywood</a>).</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><br />Mental illnesses are frequently characterized as pathological or maladaptive behavioral patterns- the idea that problems like addiction, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are patterns is not novel.<br />However, the particular maladaptive patterns that people take on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/magazine/10psyche-t.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">may be culturally dictated</a>. There is good reason to believe that anorexia nervosa, a relatively common psychological problem in the West, did not exist in the East until it arrived as part of a cultural export, packaged with other<br />Furthermore, there are some specific mental disorders that are common in other parts of the world that don't exist much here, such as "koro", the fear that your genitals are retreating into your body.<br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 22.8150005340576px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“We might think of the culture as possessing a ‘symptom repertoire’ - a range of physical symptoms available to the unconscious mind for the physical expression of psychological conflict,” Edward Shorter</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; line-height: 22.8150005340576px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here, the invariant is some sort of underlying</span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"A mask is a concrete object. When you put it on your face you receive from it a strong impulse which you have got to obey... Once the actor has acquired the elementary technique that is demanded by wearing a mask, he will begin to realize that masks dislike agitation, that they can only be animated by controlled, strong, and utterly simple actions which depend upon the richness of the inner life within the calm and balanced body of the performer. The mask absorbs the actor's personality from which it feeds. It warms his feelings and cools his head. It enables the actor to experience, in its most virulent form, the chemistry of acting: at the very moment when the actor's feelings are at their height, beneath the mask, the urgent necessity of controlling his physical actions compels him to detachment and lucidity."<br />- <i>Theater: The Rediscovery of Style</i></blockquote><div>The reason that agitations don't suit a Mask is that they are deviations from the action attractor that is the Mask- agitation and tension are caused by conflicting action plans. In an earlier chapter, Johnstone talks about movement and status. One way to learn how to play high status is to simply keep your head still while you're talking. When you're high status, you have one personality that's not being buffeted by other personalities, either internal or external, and this manifests itself as a simplicity of body. You don't need to waste any energy on extra movement when you have a single plan of action. On the other hand, low status individuals need to respond more to the desires of others, which makes them more twitchy and tense. This certainly agrees with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aDTAX7V5Ew" target="_blank">research done by Robert Sapolsky</a> that shows low-status baboons have more elevated stress hormone levels.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Try a few experiments for a while. Put a soft, warm</div><div><br /></div>Even among the rationalist community, people who pride themselves on constructing accurate world models fall prey to this tendency. Take, for example, Scott Alexander's amazing essay <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" target="_blank">Meditations on Moloch</a>. In it, he attempts to describe the ways in which systems of interacting components can, without any intent on the part of the components themselves, lead to large scale patterns of predictable behavior (think Prisoner's Dillema or Tragedy of the Commons, but with an almost all-consuming scope). The central metaphor of the piece is Moloch, a demon taken from Allen Ginsberg's poem&nbsp;<i>Howl</i>.&nbsp;He acts as the&nbsp;personification of impersonal force. Our desire for anthropomorphism is so strong that even the <i>essence&nbsp;of inhuman patterns</i> gets turned into an agent.<br /><div><br /></div><div>It's no coincidence that both Scott and Ginsberg use a demon as their metaphor- gods and other supernatural creatures carry the two qualities that we are designed to look for. They are both human and eternal. They take some pattern that clearly exists in the world and allow a way to predict the outcome. These models for the world are natural- even a physicist or a chemist who knows better will default to saying that water "wants" to get to the bottom of a hill or that an electron "wants" to relax to its ground state. Why? Because even if you explicitly know a better model for these things, the fact that you are human, with a set of hardware equipped for social modelling, means that you still default to action- or goal-based models because they're easier to compute. Since we cannot resist the temptation of personification, we must simply embrace it and find ways to harness that into the most effective model. Hence the beauty of frameworks like the 2nd law of thermodynamics (systems want to maximize their energy subject to some constraint) and Lagrangian mechanics (systems want to minimize their action subject to some constraint).</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The extreme cases of personality change in trance, hypnosis, Mask work, meditation, drug use, etc. should be considered not fringe examples of personality gone haywire but rather as insights into what personality really <i>is</i>. It's a lot like optical illusions. One way to view them is as something gone wrong- there's a decoupling between perceived and actual reality. Another way to view them is as looking directly at how perception works. The latter view is much more productive. When finding a pattern, you can't just look at what fits the pattern, you have to look at what <i>doesn't </i>fit pattern.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the case of possession cults, there is obviously not a <i>literal</i>&nbsp;spirit <i>literally</i>&nbsp;possessing a person. But this does not mean we should just write these people off as crazy. The fact that it feels exactly like a spirit moving into you gives us a clue about the mechanisms for ordinary sensations of ownership.&nbsp;</div><div><blockquote class="tr_bq">I see the 'personality' as a public-relations department for the real mind, which remains unknown. My personality always seems to be functioning, at some level, in terms of what other people think. If I am alone in a room and someone knocks on the door, then I 'come back to myself'. I do this in order to check up that my social image is presentable: are my flies done up? Is my social face properly assembled? If someone enters, and I decide that I don't have to guard myself, then I can get 'lost in the conversation'. Normal consciousness is related to transactions, real or imagined, with other people. That's how I experience it, and I note widespread reports of people in isolation, or totally rejected by other people, who experience 'personality disintegration'.<br />- Keith Johnstone, &nbsp;<i>Impro: Improvisation and the Theater</i>&nbsp;</blockquote><br />Most of the disconcerting effect of eye contact comes from <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771400119X" target="_blank">increased awareness of your own body</a>.<br /><br /><br /></div><div>We should not think of ourselves as a static personality, but rather as a system of patterns that adapts fluidly to the particular circumstances we find ourselves in. This is obvious upon any reflection of the way we act in social situations- you act differently with your mom than your friends than your teachers than your coworkers. There is a fluidity<br /><br /></div><div>Rigid adherence to a defined personality is the fundamental stuff of tragedy- a tragic hero is one that has a flaw that refuses to adapt to its environment, and in so doing tears apart the entire system of self.<br /><br />Philippe Rochat&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This may also give us some insight into why Facebook is so pernicious- it forces us to present a single "face" to everyone. The issue with this isn't privacy in the sense of wanting to keep secrets. It is a failure to build structures that facilitate genuine interaction- structures on a human scale. Homogenization of interaction leads to a corresponding compression of the self. We make ourselves our own tragic heroes, though our stories end not with a bang, but with a whimper.</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Each pattern is a generic solution to some system of forces in the world. But the forces are never quite the same. Since the exact configuration of the surroundings at any one place and time is always unique, the configuration of the forces which the system is subject to is also unique- no other system of forces is ever subject to exactly the same configuration of forces. If the system is responsible to the forces it is subject to, it follows that the system too, must be unique; it cannot be exactly like any other, even though it is roughly similar. This is not an accidental consequence of the uniqueness of each system: it is an essential aspect of the life and wholeness of each part. <i>In short, there is a character in natural things which is created by the fact that they are reconciled, exactly, to their inner forces... This character will happen anywhere, where &nbsp;part of the world is so well reconciled to its own inner forces that it is true to its own nature.</i>"<br />- Christopher Alexander, <i>The Timeless Way of Building</i></blockquote><br /><br /><br />In a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius/transcript?language=en" target="_blank">wonderful TED talk</a>, Elizabeth Gilbert also makes the argument that artists should view themselves as channeling an objective thing as opposed to putting pressure on their selves to produce work.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="366489" id="t-366489" style="box-sizing: border-box;

I'm currently reading through Daniel Dennett's book "Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking" and I'll (hopefully) be making posts inspired by it over the next couple of days. The book is essentially a series of thought experiments (a.k.a. intuition pumps) designed to help you think about meaning, evolution, consciousness, and free will, as well as a bunch of commentary by Dennett to help you think about these topics in his way.<div><br /></div><div>When we test theories, we cannot simply look at them on their own, in a "hypothetical vacuum." We must always compare one hypothesis to another one. In particular, in any field, we want to have a notion of what it means for there to be "nothing actually happening," or a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis" target="_blank">null hypothesis</a>. In medicine, whether or not a particular compound works is roughly determined by looking at the rate of people getting better taking the medicine versus those who take a placebo, the placebo here defining the null hypothesis. In general, though, it can be hard to define what "nothing happening" means in any given field.</div><div>In the study of the formation of river networks, for instance,&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems to me to be a reasonable conjecture that a field of study should be defined by its null hypothesis.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Evolution by natural selection forms a base for a null hypothesis of any replicating system&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The 2nd law of thermodynamics is the null hypothesis for physical systems with large numbers of degrees of freedom, or more generally any system about which our information degrades over time. Namely, the entropy of the system is always maximized given the constraints of the system, provided there are no other forces at play. In theory, the last part about "other forces" describes things that should be subsumed under "constraints", but this is where the notion of the null hypothesis comes in.<br /><script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js" type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Config({  extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],  tex2jax: {      inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],  },  "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] } }); </script><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>We <i>do</i>&nbsp;see ideas that spread in this way- namely, internet memes.

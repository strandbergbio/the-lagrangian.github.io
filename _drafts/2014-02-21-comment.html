<br /><br />C-14<br />How is it produced<br />- cosmic rays <br />Decays when in earth<br />data<br />alternative explanations<br />what this does and does not say<br /><br /><br />Now, there's an important question here: if C-14 has a half-life of 5730 years and the earth is 4.5 billion years old, why do we still see any C-14? The answer is that it gets produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere.<br /><br />Cosmic rays are super high energy particles that fly in from way out in space- their origin is mysterious and the explanation for why they can sometimes have such extraordinarily high energies is still an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics#Astronomy_and_astrophysics" target="_blank">open problem in physics</a>. These particles collide with other particles and atoms in the upper atmosphere, producing showers of yet more particles, some of which are neutrons. High-energy neutrons can interact with nitrogen in the following way:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">N-14 + n -&gt; C-14 + p + e</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This means that </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Importantly, these neutrons will not penetrate the ground, meaning that only carbon in the atmosphere can be converted into C-14. Carbon that has been buried in the form of hydrocarbons will simply decay, so by the time we take it back out of the ground it has effectively zero C-14.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">It is a well-documented effect that the amount of CO_{2} in the atmosphere has been rising rapidly since the beginning of the industrial revolution.

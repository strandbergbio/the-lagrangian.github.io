I have no such economic ties, but I figured I'd describe a bit about my eating habits and cultural background so that you know what biases or assumptions I might have. Furthermore, you may use this information to discredit as biased any information I present that might imply you should put in effort to change your behaviors.

I come from an upper middle class suburban Massachusetts family, and consider myself pretty educated. I don't currently have a job, so I've been focusing a lot on the price of food lately. My first brush with eating less meat was in high school when I told my parents I wanted to be pescetarian and they thought that meant I was converting to some sort of religion. I didn't decide to become vegetarian again until my sophomore year of high school, after I had been dating my vegetarian girlfriend for a couple of months (she never pushed vegetarianism on me, but it would be silly to claim that this wasn't a major reason for my "conversion"). I have never felt particularly passionate about animals or animal rights or even about vegetarianism in general, but I felt compelled by numerous small arguments from different sources. The thing that tipped my decision was the general argument that much more environmental damage is done by feeding animals plants and then eating them as opposed to just eating the<br />My "vegetarianism" has always been a bit loose- I probably average one or two meat-based meals every other week. Also I went to Scotland for two weeks a bit ago and basically ate meat the whole time, even when there were other options, so there's that.</div><div>I also have a sister who has been vegan for many years.</div><div>My parents have pretty much always been supportive of my and my sister's eating preferences, and my mom mostly cooks vegetarian food now (when she cooks).</div><div>I predict that the overall outcome of this research will result in something like "being mostly or entirely vegan is the best way to go for pretty much everyone, except for some edge cases x,y, and z where it's probably okay to eat meat." This assumption may sway the data I pick.

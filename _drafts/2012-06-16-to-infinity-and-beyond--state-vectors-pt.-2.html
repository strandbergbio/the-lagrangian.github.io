In my <a href="http://the-lagrangian.blogspot.com/2012/06/moving-towards-better-model-state.html" target="_blank">last post on state vectors</a>, we came up with a way of representing the position of a particle using an infinite-dimensional vector space. This is a pretty nifty model, but it's oddly restrictive. Your state vector is only allowed to be in the direction of a single basis vector. This is odd- most of the time we would assume that you would be allowed to have a state vector that is an arbitrary superposition- that is, an arbitrary additive combination- of basis vectors. It's as if you<br /><br />Another seemingly arbitrary restriction is that the magnitude of the vector in any given direction can only be 0 or 1. Why can't we choose from the integers, or the real numbers, or complex numbers, or quaternions, or some other crazy mathematical object?<br /><br />I bring this up not because these restrictions are a <i>defect</i> of the model (they aren't), but because they reveal to us an opportunity to explore generalizations of our current model. A new model built this way could be effective in explaining a broader range of physical phenomena without having to overhaul too many of the techniques we've already developed.<br /><br />As an example of this kind of motivation, consider<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />How to motivate going between position and momentum basis?

This doesn't need to be the case, however. For instance, if you detected that there were two potential options that you couldn't really tell apart, you could just flip a coin to pick and be done with it. This would make more sense since the tradeoff between time spent and marginal utility gain becomes bad very quickly.<br /><br />To get a sense of why this might be the case, consider bees. Bees need to make decisions about where to migrate to a different colony, and to do that, they need to somehow convince all the bees to move in the same direction at the same time. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q-5XjWZlosg/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-5XjWZlosg?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />Video (starting at 3:02)<br />- Bees encode the utility of their findings in their butt wiggles (no, seriously)<br />- <br /><script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js" type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Config({  extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],  tex2jax: {      inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],  },  "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] } }); </script>

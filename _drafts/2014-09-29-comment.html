&nbsp;(<i>Epistemic status: thoughtdump of mediocre philosophy about something that's really important</i>)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">An untrained body is like an untuned musical instrument- its sounding box is filled with a confusing and ugly jangle of useless noises that prevent the true melody from being heard. When the actor's instrument, his body, is tuned by exercises, the wasteful tensions and habits vanish. He is now ready to open himself to the unlimited possibilities of emptiness. But there is a price to pay: in front of this unfamiliar void there is, naturally, fear. Even when one has had long experience performing, each time one starts again, as one finds oneself on the edge of the carpet, this fear- of emptiness in oneself, and of emptiness in the space- reappears. At once one tries to fill it so as to get away from the fear, so as to have something to say or do. It takes real confidence to sit still or stay silent. <i>A large part of our excessive, unnecessary manifestations come from a terror that if we are not somehow signaling all the time that we exist, we will in fact no longer be there.</i>&nbsp;</blockquote><br />This terror is justified.<br />When you stop signaling that you exist, that pattern of signals stops existing. And what is a "self" besides a particular pattern of signals?<br /><br />Physical theories can be thought of as dealing with information<br />(it is therefore a huge problem that we don't have a well-defined notion of quantum conditional probability)<br />The idea of self-narrative is sufficiently pervasive in our culture that<br /><br />Everything is simultaneously that thing and a signal about something else:<br /><br />There are at least a couple of plays that reflect this principle: <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, <i>No Exit</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Lover</i>.<br />In <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, everything Didi and Gogo do is a performance to fill the void. It's not a coincidence that they're based on vaudeville actors.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">What do we do now?</span>&nbsp;<br /><b style="background-color: white;">VLADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">While waiting.</span><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">While waiting.</span><br /><i style="background-color: white;">Silence.</i><br /><b style="background-color: white;">VLADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">We could do our exercises.</span><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Our movements.</span><b style="background-color: white;">VLADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Our elevations.</span><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Our relaxations.</span><b style="background-color: white;">VLADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Our elongations.</span><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Our relaxations.</span><b style="background-color: white;">V</b><b style="background-color: white;">LADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">To warm us up.</span><b style="background-color: white;">ESTRAGON:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">To calm us down.</span><b style="background-color: white;">VLADIMIR:&nbsp;</b><span style="background-color: white;">Off we go.</span><br /><i style="background-color: white;">Vladimir hops from one foot to the other.

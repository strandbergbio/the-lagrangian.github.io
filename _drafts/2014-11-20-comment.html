(<i>Warning: theoretical physics</i>) <br /><br />Since entropy is a way to measure probability distributions, it depends critically on the assumptions that go into determining the probability.&nbsp; <br /><br />Entropy is a feature of a model about the world, not about the world itself. Interestingly, this is what has made statistical mechanics such a powerful and enduring field of study. It was invented prior to the existence of quantum mechanics and relativity but managed to survive the shocks of those revolutions in physics because it's not a physical theory- it's a meta-theory.<br /><br />Given a state space for some physical system and some known quantities that are functions of the state but don't uniquely specify it, what probability distribution should you make over possible states of the system? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It is common to hear that "the entropy of the universe is increasing" and this seems to correspond well with our observations. However, the entropy of a density matrix is constant under unitary transformation. If we assume that the universe consists of one density matrix <br /><br />There are many systems for which entropy decreases as a function of time <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why <i>isn't</i> there an arrow of space? Actually, there is! "Henceforth space by itself, and time by  itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of  union of the two will preserve an independent reality". - Hermann Minkowski<br />The key insight of the theory of relativity was that space and time are (almost) the same thing. Time and space can be "rotated" into one another*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*Scare quotes since the relevant invariant is ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2, as opposed to ds^2 = dt^2 + dx^2 if it were a rotation in the standard Euclidean sense. The minus sign distiguishes the time direction from space directions, but the fact that you can rotate one into the other&nbsp; <br /><script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js" type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Config({  extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],  tex2jax: {      inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],  },  "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] } }); </script>

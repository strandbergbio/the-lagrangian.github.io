I have a new rule about philosophical writing: it should contain a high enough density of concrete information such that you still get something interesting out of it even if you disagree with or are already convinced of the author's thesis. In this case, I agreed<br /><div>At 234 pages, it's not a long book, but it did have a tendency to draw out arguments longer than they needed to go,<br />Although I found the book interesting, it is in need of some compression<br /><script src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js" type="text/javascript">MathJax.Hub.Config({  extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],  tex2jax: {      inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],      displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],  },  "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] } }); </script><br /><div>I will try to boil down the essential observations (at least those listed in the book) that drive this thesis.</div><div><br /></div><div>In Maslow's famous "pit of despair" experiments with monkeys, he showed that infant monkeys would preferentially go to a fuzzy, comfortable fake mother that didn't provide food over a cold, uncomfortable fake mother that did provide food.</div><div><br /></div><div>adults in the Biami tribe of Papua New Guinea, a place without clear rivers or glass and hence without mirrors, recoil in horror when presented with their first image of themselves.<br /><br />He talks about a man who has a dream in which his wife and lover meet him in the same space and he dies- Rochat takes this as a literal death in the sense of being cut off socially<br /><br />The self is revealed in the constant transition of one social marks to another. The image I have in mind is of a pole with a number of spokes coming out of it, and each spoke has a mask affixed to the end. This whole structure turns, slowly at first but then faster and faster. You see the blur of masks whooshing past</div><div><br /></div><div>Rochat conducted a study with two year old children, in which they had a post-it note<br />American children took the post-it off their heads when they saw it in the mirror, but Kenyan children did not. Rochat takes this as evidence in both cases that the children are aware of themselves in a social context, and that these differing responses reflect social differences. In Kenya, he argues, children are given much less leeway for individual decision making than in the US.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>By two years old, children are capable of becoming embarrassed by looking in the mirror.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I wonder what the difference is between solitary confinement and voluntary solitary experiences.

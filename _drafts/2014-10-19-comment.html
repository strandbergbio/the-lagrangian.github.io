Are these part of a single spectrum of conscious states or are they "orthogonal," so to speak?</div><div><br />- Why does conscious experience seem to be unified? That is<br />- On the other hand, why is conscious experience separable?</div><div>- What evolutionary advantage does consciousness confer over "having the lights on with nobody home"?</div><div>- Why breathing is normally unconscious, but can very easily be consciously controlled?<br />- Furthermore, why it is so hard to learn to be conscious of your breath without controlling it? (Try this at home- it's step one in learning how to meditate)<br />- Why does there seem to be a "<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" target="_blank">hard problem of consciousness</a>"?<br /><br /></div><div>- Why you are not typically aware of e.g. digestion</div><div>- How do out-of-body experiences occur?</div><div>- Why does conscious perception seem to be "<a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/10/transparency-of-warped-windows.html" target="_blank">transparent</a>"? (As an example, say that you are looking at a cup. If you try to focus on the experience of looking at the cup, you tend to slip and look at the cup instead. The experience of the cup is like a transparent window that you have difficulty looking at itself.)<br />- Why do almost all animals systematically become unconscious once a day (i.e. sleep)?<br />- Why do they then enter the quasi-conscious state of dreaming?<br />- Why do consciousness and quantum mechanics seem somehow linked? (I am purposefully remaining vague and agnostic on this- I swear to god, if you take this as me supporting Penrose's ideas on e<br />- How are conscious states socially mediated?<br />- As an extension, are conscious states deeply influenced by culturally available technologies?<br /><br /></div><div>Morsella:<br /><br /><br /><br />- Why are there near-death experiences?<br />- At what point in human development do we become conscious? Or, at what points do we gain various components of consciousness?</div><div><br /></div>

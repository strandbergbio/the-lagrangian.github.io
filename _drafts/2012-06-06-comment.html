<h3>     Hubris in Model-Making </h3>I promised at the end of my post on <a href="http://the-lagrangian.blogspot.com/2012/06/why-wave-particle-duality-is-load-of.html" target="_blank">wave-particle duality</a> that I would explain "what's <i>really</i> going on." This was actually a really bad mistake on my part, and goes against precisely what I was trying to argue in that post. What I meant was that I will explain a different model with different underlying mathematical concepts which can be used to explain a host of phenomena in a way that the classical models could not. The model I will discuss is called non-relativistic quantum mechanics. While this model is great and provides us with all sorts of deep physical insight, mistaking these successes with having fully described reality is precisely the trap that you get into with the notion of "wave-particle duality"- namely, stopping progress by assuming that you have the be-all-end-all model.<br /><br />It is important to keep in mind that we as a species don't yet have a model that can be truly, solidly considered to be what's <i>really</i> going on. Between the Standard Model of particle physics and Einstein's theory of general relativity, we have fantastically precise and elegant models of a very large range of physical processes, but the fact that I had to list two models there is just one of many indications that we are not yet able to completely describe the fundamental workings of the universe on its own terms. Whether or not such a model can be found is an issue that you can debate, but as far as I'm concerned, the only way to know is to go out and look for it.<br /><br />So, without further ado, let's start our path towards rethinking our models of physics by thinking deeply about classical mechanics.<br /><h3><a name='more'></a>     &nbsp;</h3><h3>      Classical Mechanics: The Standard Way</h3>Physicists are in the business of describing the physical states of systems. This is almost tautologically true, but considering what this means turns out to be a really fruitful pursuit.<br /><br />Let's say that you are trying to describe something like the orbits of planets in the solar system*. The first thing you do is make an abstraction- you don't care about the size or rotation of any of these planets; all you care about is how they orbit the sun. So you consider each planet to be a point with a single identifying feature- its mass. This is a great step in the right direction if we want to start making a mathematical description, since people having been coming up with ways of dealing with points since at least Euclid's time.<br /><br />Speaking of Euclid, our next step is to describe how these points relate to each other. Since our problem is asking what the orbits of the planets are, which is intrinsically a problem of finding functions of position with respect to time, it makes sense to arrange them in a metric space that describes their relative spatial distances. In fact, our abstraction of the planets as points was already assuming that we would describe the system spatially. (Since we're not going to consider relativity for the time being, we'll stick to Euclidean space.)<br /><br />Now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Well, duh, of course we put things in a spatial configuration- things exist in space! We went over this on the first day of my high school physics class!" The reason that I emphasize our <i>choice</i> of description here is that when we make the transition to quantum mechanics this choice will not be as trivial.<br /><br />The standard next step is to pick out three orthogonal directions, that is, directions that are at right angles to each other. We'll call them $x$, $y$ and $z$ as per convention. We then create a vector pointing in each of these directions and call these vectors $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$, and $\vec{z}$, respectively. The wonderful thing about these vectors is that we can add them up in various quantities to get any position vector we want. For example, the spot 3 meters forward, 2 meters left, and 1 meter up could be expressed as the vector $3\vec{x} + 2\vec{y} + \vec{z}$. In general, if we talk about any vector space, then a set of <i>basis vectors </i>for that space is a set of vectors that we can add together to get any other vector in that space. This concept is very important for this and future posts. For notational convenience, instead of expressing vectors as a sum of weighted basis vectors, we simply give an ordered list of numbers corresponding to the weights. The example above would then be written as (3, 2, 1).<br /><br />In addition to position, we'll also want to specify the velocities of the particles. The set of basis vectors for the velocities is just given by $\frac{\partial \vec{x}}{\partial t}$, $\frac{\partial \vec{y}}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial \vec{z}}{\partial t}$. Similarly, if we wanted to describe a particle moving 5 meters per second forward, we would write the vector (5,0,0).<br /><br />Now, let's say that we want a single vector that describes both the position and velocity of the particle. It's easy: we simply glom the basis vectors together to get a 6-dimensional vector space. This doesn't mean that we're adding on extra physical spatial dimensions (there's no string theory to be found here), but merely that we can keep track of these 6 different parameters using a single vector. The example particle at the position and velocity described would just have the vector (3,2,1,5,0,0).<br /><br />So now we want to move on to describing the entire system. Each particle in the system has its own corresponding 6-dimensional vector space, and we just take one for each of the particles and glom those all together to get one giant vector space. Specifically, in the example of looking at orbits in the solar system, we would have a 9 $\times$ 6 = 54-dimensional vector space! Again, no string theory going on, just a lot of  information packed into a single vector. To describe what the state the system is in, all we need to do is specify its corresponding vector in this crazy vector space. This vector is called, quite aptly, the <i>state vector.</i><br /><br />The wonderful thing about the state vector is that it gives us complete description of the state of the system. What I mean by "complete" is that any knowledge that we can possibly have about the system can in principle be derived from this information. Wow! That's pretty cool! (Sneak preview: this property of the state vector will carry over into quantum mechanics, but with an important caveat. Stay tuned!)<br /><br /><h3>    Mixing Things Up a Bit</h3>Now, let's say that you've been doing classical mechanics for a while and are bored with this way of representing systems. You're feeling clever, and decide that while you like this whole thing with expressing states as vectors, working with finite-dimensional vectors is cramping your style. So you represent the system in the following way: instead of using three directions as your set of basis vectors, you make a basis in which there's one vector corresponding to each point in space. (Yes, this makes your set of basis vectors uncountably infinite. This is mathematically perfectly sound.) Then, to talk about a particle being in a given location, you simply assign it a vector that is magnitude 1 along the basis vector corresponding to its location, and 0 along every other basis vector**. If you could write out such a vector (which you can't), it would look something like<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">(...0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0...)</div><br />where the 1 is at the basis vector corresponding to that point. We can then do the same thing with velocities - simply assign a basis vector to every possible velocity (also uncountably infinite). You then glom the position and velocity basis vectors together, and then glom the bases corresponding to different particles together. Ta-da! You have another vector space in which you can specify your state vector!<br /><br />This seems at face value like a completely ridiculous exercise. We've moved from being able to express things in terms of a 54-dimensional vector space to expressing them in terms of an uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector space! Why would you ever want to do this? To find out, you'll have to read the next post.<br /><br />What I want to focus on right now is the fact that you can use this setup to make the same exact physical predictions as you did with the previous one. This concept- that you can change the mathematics going into the theory without changing the physics- is a key weapon in the arsenal of the physicist for use in problem solving. In fact, theories known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory" target="_blank">gauge theories</a>, which underlie our descriptions of fundamental particle physics, can be constructed simply by considering the ways in which the physics should remain unchanged if you change certain parameters in the math.<br /><br />Recognizing the distinction of the math and the physics also allows us to not have too much "hubris" about our models, as I mentioned in the first section. A large part of the reason that quantum theory is so difficult to swallow at first is because we think of electrons as <i>being</i> particles and light as <i>being</i> waves, when really these are mathematical models that we use to try and describe the physical phenomena we call (for instance) electrons and photons. In reality, electrons are electrons and photons are photons- they don't care whether or not they can be intuitively represented in the minds of people. As physicists, it's our job to explore how best to describe them, hopefully getting as close to their own language as possible.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Throughout, I am excluding Pluto as a planet, so the sun plus eight planets gives nine particles overall. Sorry, Pluto enthusiasts.<br />** For those with some background in differential equations, we actually need to use a Dirac delta function instead of just the number 1, but that's a technicality that doesn't give us much insight here.

A quick note to save someone else the 20 minutes I spent looking into this: there is a regulatory protein complex called CCR4-NOT that degrades poly-A tails on mRNA. The name CCR4 here stands for carbon catabolite repression 4, and is named after the [protein in yeast](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000000019).

This has nothing to do with the human immune protein named [CCR4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000183813-CCR4), which stands for C-C motif chemokine receptor 4, and is expressed primarily by T-regulatory cells.

In humans the homologous version of the yeast protein is called [CNOT6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000113300-CNOT6) (per table 1 in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3376659/)), for CCR4-NOT complex 6.

Hope that clears things up for another poor soul wondering how an immune specific protein could be generally implicated in mRNA degradation.

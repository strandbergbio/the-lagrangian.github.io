<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">(<i>Warning: Started out as discussion of intelligence, turned into a screed about physics and impostor syndrome, and is generally more grumpy than it needs to be</i><i>.

It's the  simplest way of decomposing the world into internal and external  capabilities. Each gets reduced to a single summary statistic- for  resources, you typically use money as the measure; for intelligence, IQ. <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">O</span>utput <span style="font-family: inherit;">is then some</span> </span>monotonically increasing function of these  two variables. <span style="font-family: inherit;">T</span>his is reasonable in the case that they are the only<span style="font-family: inherit;"> </span>variables you know about.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IQ is the simplest possible <span style="font-family: inherit;">quantity you can use for <i>predicting</i> output</span>, but it is not sufficiently detailed to say anything about<i> causality</i>. Like  many other predictive variables, it's only useful insofar as you don't  have more specific information about the domain. If, for instance, you  want to <span style="font-family: inherit;">hire</span> someone <span style="font-family: inherit;">who can</span> fix your company's problems <span style="font-family: inherit;">but</span> you have no idea what those problems are, <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">selecting </span></span>based on IQ  makes sense. But if you <span style="font-family: inherit;">have </span>domain-specific knowledge about <span style="font-family: inherit;">your problems, </span>you can to pick a person whose  specific strategies will help. (See<a data-mce-href="http://carcinisation.com/2014/09/09/considerations-on-reasoning-by-anecdote/" href="http://carcinisation.com/2014/09/09/considerations-on-reasoning-by-anecdote/" shape="rect" target="_blank"> this discussion</a> of why anecdotal reasoning can be better than statistical reasoning.) The  problem with "intelligence" is not that it's meaningless, but rather  that it's a single summary statistic of an infinitely huge space. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">We  should view intelligence as a collection of strategies that either have  or do not have adaptive fit to particular situations. This doesn't necessarily jive with standard measurements of intelligence. For  instance, intelligence is in large  part measured by capacity for articulating language well and for being  able to think on an abstract level. But there are many tasks for which  thinking gets in the way. Modelling social interactions explicitly can  take the value out of them. Being trained in  jumping to meta-level discussion is especially pernicious. If you can't  stay on an object level, you can't do anything. Abstractions  are only useful insofar as they cash out in concrete terms- otherwise  you become addicted to thoughts about thoughts because you've spent your  whole life being rewarded (by yourself and others) for having cool  insights. But this addiction to "<a href="http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/09/trying-to-see-through-unified-theory-of.html">insight porn</a>" can be maladaptive in cases where reality is inherently messy. (That is to say, almost all the time.) <span style="font-family: inherit;">F</span>ocusing on language skills as <span style="font-family: inherit;">a signal</span> of intelligence <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">creates a sinkhole of thought where the ener<span style="font-family: inherit;">gy of <span style="font-family: inherit;">potential creation goes to die.</span></span></span></span> Instead  of learning something and then going on to apply that to a problem, you <span style="font-family: inherit;">theorize and write essays</span> about it because that's what all of your favorite  thinkers do.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As  someone who was a physics major at MIT, I'm often told that physics is  supposed to teach you a way of thinking about the world that will enable  you to solve any problem. But does it? Most problems that one works on  as a physicist (at least in general undergraduate classes) are ones that  are analytically tractable- that have some universal solution. As we  know though, <a data-mce-href="http://the-lagrangian.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-eternal-werewolf-hunt.html" href="http://the-lagrangian.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-eternal-werewolf-hunt.html" shape="rect" target="_blank">competition is inherently intractable</a>. Complicated coevolving nonlinear systems are much more ubiquitous than ones with simple, tractable causal structure. Studying physics encourages a mindset of simplified models, but attempts at  simplification of complex systems either fail, or succeed at the cost of  other values.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EfDtxLCDe48/VUkUoS6jibI/AAAAAAAAA84/kKNGKGtRmo0/s1600/physicists.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EfDtxLCDe48/VUkUoS6jibI/AAAAAAAAA84/kKNGKGtRmo0/s1600/physicists.png" height="400" width="265" /></a></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br data-mce-bogus="1" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The  physics mindset of extracting the most important abstraction out of a  complex system is only useful at the beginning of a cycle of  competition. Once things get moving, the specific details in the problem take over. </span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You  see this all the time when people in the "hard" sciences talk about the  "soft" sciences. Physicists complain that biologists or psychologists  lack simple, central organizing models that explain the core phenomena in a way that you can derive the dynamics from first principles. But they forget that physics is restricted to the simplest possible physical systems. Say what you will about the difficulty of learning quantum mechanics, but modelling a single electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is way simpler than modelling even a single cell in the human body. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Perhaps  even more importantly, it encourages a mindset of thinking as opposed  to doing. Physicists tend to <span style="font-family: inherit;">think more like</span> philosophers than  engineers, because most of what they do is mental  refactoring, as opposed to a constant loop of action and  feedback with their environment. Programmers constantly get feedback from a compiler, but the loop on theoretical physics tends to be quite long (in cosmology there are years between updated measurements of the CMB to test theories of the early universe). </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></div><span style="font-size: small;">Physicists can also fall into the trap of <span style="font-family: inherit;">taking  ideas too seriously. My favorite characterization of this problem is  treating&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/18b/reason_as_memetic_immune_disorder/" shape="rect" target="_blank">reasoning as a memetic immune disorder</a>. People most of the time default to socially learned behaviors<span style="font-family: inherit;"> that can work in everyone's favor <span style="font-family: inherit;">eve<span style="font-family: inherit;">n if they seem <span style="font-family: inherit;">illog<span style="font-family: inherit;">ical when you analy<span style="font-family: inherit;">ze them. But because you are encouraged to<span style="font-family: inherit;"> trust the results of your analysis, you're more likely to do things that are dumb in reality.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </span></span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E_a9MB1JK9s/VUkflilOiUI/AAAAAAAAA9I/75McLs36WV8/s1600/drama.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E_a9MB1JK9s/VUkflilOiUI/AAAAAAAAA9I/75McLs36WV8/s1600/drama.png" height="180" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It doesn't help that most reasoning in physics is based on eternal laws and invariant properties. I think that this tendency toward inviolable, universal world models leaves physicists particularly prone to impostor syndrome.</span></span></div></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">----------------------</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">People resist the idea that skills are useful only relative to particular environments because there's a slippery slope  towards saying that everyone is a special snowflake that has their own  unique abilities. "Everyone is a winner" rightfully leaves a  bad taste in your mouth.&nbsp;This perspective is damaging because it places  value on the presupposed uniqueness of an individual.&nbsp;There are about 7  billion people in the world. There are not 7 billion unique niches for  economically or socially useful activities. As such, there will always  be other people competing for more or less the same role, and all but  one will not be the best. And you can't ignore the people who are better  than you either. Because of the way social networks form, your friends  are on average&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/523566/how-the-friendship-paradox-makes-your-friends-better-than-you-are/" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/523566/how-the-friendship-paradox-makes-your-friends-better-than-you-are/" shape="rect" target="_blank">better than you in every way</a>.&nbsp;</span></span><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The  idea that your value derives from some unique property of your self is  what leads to impostor syndrome (at least in my experience). If I'm  supposedly so unique, why can I observe evidence of my non-uniqueness all around me? For every component of my self that I value, I can identify both people that are better than me at it and times when I have sabotaged the development of that component. This uniqueness assumption is reinforced in the rhetoric used in combating impostor syndrome. Everyone supposes that you <i>actually</i>&nbsp;have  a unique self hiding under there and that all this negativity is just  some temporary mental block that's getting in the way of you seeing  that*.&nbsp;</span></span><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But this "block" is actually a result of taking this  model seriously and noticing how it doesn't seem to correspond to  reality. Every time you fail to measure up to your supposed value, every  time you run into someone who is better at your special skill than you  are, a crack appears in this facade of uniqueness. The reality is that you don't have an inherent value. Your value is a function of "you" and "the environment," neither of which are fixed.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">(Forgive  me<span style="font-family: inherit;">: </span>this is an easy way to sound deep without providing a more useful framework for thinking about problems of value.)</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">People  who think they have inherent value are just ones that have good fit  with the environment that they work in. The assumption of inherent value is  psychologically protecting and very nice. You don't need to waste time  wondering whether or not you should be doing what you're doing. When  things are going as expected, you can just treat value as an invariant  that holds for the system. And then things change. And then you try and  hold on to this invariant, but it never existed in the first place. It  was just a summary statistic.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">You're not an impostor, but you're not real either. The very notion of  being an impostor implies an inherent reality from which you deviate.  That's the insight that you really need to get over impostor syndrome:  seeing through the idea that there is a single true self. Any model of self that makes an attempt at incorporating all of your actual thoughts and actions will inevitably run into counterexamples. Then it's forced between suppressing that data or using it to revise your self-model into something horrible and maladaptive. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">People graduating from college  talk about being "a real person" or entering "the real world" as if  either of these things existed. The behavior patterns that you have to  take on to get by are different as a working person in your mid-twenties  than a student in your early twenties, but that doesn't make the world  of work more real. It has a different set of constraints on adaptive behavior, and thus gives people a different sense of constructed reality. But it is not itself "more real."</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The world has regularities, and so do  you, but it is impossible to tell in advance whether or not a  particular trait of yours is a truly "inherent" property, or whether  it's just a motif that happens to be recurring a lot in this movement  of your life.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">---------------</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br clear="none" /></span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As T.S. Eliot argues in his essay <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237868"><i>Tradition and the Individual Talent</i></a>, we place too much value on the uniqueness of artists:</span></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">One of the facts that might come to light in this process is our  tendency to insist, when we praise a poet, upon those aspects of his  work in which he least resembles anyone else. In these aspects or parts  of his work we pretend to find what is individual, what is the peculiar  essence of the man. We dwell with satisfaction upon the poet’s  difference from his predecessors, especially his immediate predecessors;  we endeavour to find something that can be isolated in order to be  enjoyed. Whereas if we approach a poet without this prejudice we shall  often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of his  work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their  immortality most vigorously.</blockquote></div><div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Instead of focusing on <i>being</i> invariant, true selves, we should focus on <i>channeling </i>the truth. I want to write more on this, but it'll have to wait for later since I have already spent too much time on this post.
